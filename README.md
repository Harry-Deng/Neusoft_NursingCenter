## NEUSoft 2021 summer internship program | Nursing Center
If you reference my code, remember to **Star**!
- The NEUSoft 2021 summer internship program included a rudimentary retirement center management system entirely developed using the Java language.

- The whole project was built using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, with the system's backend logic written in the Java programming language. The front-end Graphical User Interface (GUI) was developed with JavaFX and CSS for enhanced visual appeal. The data was stored locally in a rudimentary format using JSON.

- If you intend to run this project on your machine, please note that I have not packaged it. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that your **Java JDK version** and **JavaFX version** are consistent with the project requirements! And remember to include the **third-party libraries**!

- Although the project was rudimentary, it achieved an exceptional score of 99 in the final assessment. To the students who can benefit from this project, I want to encourage you not to fear new technologies and bug fixing. This internship is an important process for the transformation of your coding abilities. Keep pushing forward!

- If you need any help, please contact me. You can ask your mentor and she/he will help you find me:).
